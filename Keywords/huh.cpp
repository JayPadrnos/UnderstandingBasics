User-Friendly Interface:

Structured Navigation: Implement a clear hierarchical structure for subjects, categories, and keywords. Users should be able to easily navigate through different sections.

Search Functionality: Include a search feature that allows users to quickly find keywords based on their queries. Implement search filters such as subjects, categories, or keywords.

Interactive Display: Present information in a readable and visually appealing manner. Consider using tables, lists, and formatting to enhance readability.

Add, Edit, Delete: Provide clear options for users to add new keywords, edit existing ones, and delete entries. Use user-friendly prompts and dialogs for these actions.

Contextual Help: Offer tooltips, hints, or a "Help" section to guide users on how to use the program effectively.

Programmer-Friendly Architecture:

Modular Code: Divide your program into well-defined modules or classes. Each class should have a clear responsibility, such as handling user input, managing data, or displaying information.

Data Structures: Design a solid data structure to hold keyword information. Separate the data structures from the program logic for easy modification.

Configurable Settings: Use configuration files or constants to store user-friendly text, paths to data files, or other customizable aspects. This allows developers to make changes without altering the core code.

Data Storage Abstraction: Implement a data storage layer that abstracts the specifics of how data is stored. This could include saving to files, using a database, or other forms of persistent storage.

Version Control: If multiple developers are involved, use version control (e.g., Git) to manage code changes collaboratively while maintaining a history of changes.

Documentation: Document your code with clear comments, explaining the purpose and usage of classes and functions. This helps both you and other developers understand the codebase.

Error Handling: Implement meaningful error messages and graceful error handling. This makes debugging and maintenance easier.

User and Developer Collaboration:

Editable Content: For user-friendly content modification, provide an easy way for users to add, edit, or delete keywords. This could be through a built-in editor or through external data files.

Developer-Friendly Customization: Allow developers to easily modify the program's behavior by exposing configurable options in a central configuration file or through a user-friendly interface.

Version Updates: Implement a mechanism to handle program updates without losing user-modified content. This might involve migration scripts for data updates.

User Feedback: Include a feedback mechanism for users to suggest improvements, report bugs, or share their experiences. This input can guide both user experience and developer priorities.
